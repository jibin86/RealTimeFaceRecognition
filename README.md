# Real-Time Face Recognition
Real-time face detection and recognition system fine-tuned with the KFace dataset using deep learning models such as FaceNet and ArcFace. The project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of facial recognition in real-world scenarios.

## weights
Pretrain model  and trained model are put in [google cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZRSG0ZegbVkVwUd8wUIQx8W7yfZ_ki1). The model could be put as follows:
